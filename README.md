The-Big-Stock-Market-News-Webscraper-and-Sentiment-Analyzer!


### How it all began
It was 2013 (or 2012 I think, not sure), I was still working in a futures trading company (I worked numbers and information about soy, corn and wheat) and...a tweet came online from a very famous news anchor that the US president had died...for a few seconds, the market went into massive despair! Turns out that the guy's Twitter account got hacked - a few minutes later (not more than 10) someone fixed that information...but that company I was working for managed to make a profit out of it! So, back then, I thought: man...if only we could have an automated system that could monitor all news channels about the stock market...


### Technology has moved forward!
So, **The Big Stock Market News Webscraper and Sentiment Analyzer!**, or TBSMNWASA for short, is a project that was borne out of that question I had back then. It is an ambitious project, that will move forward based upon the belief that we, pythonistas who hold the power of webscraping, holding the almighty swords of Beautiful Soup and Scrapy (and so many others) will be able to correlate variables related to news being written out there and the scary, and often thought as unpredictable, stock market.


### Aren't you a bit presumptuous in your assumptions?
Yes. However, if science weren't presumptuous, many of our scientific advances wouldn't happen.
